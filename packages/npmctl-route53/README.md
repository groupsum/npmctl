`npmctl-route53` is the AWS Route 53 DNS provider package for `npmctl`. Install it when you want desired-state DNS records or DNS diagnostics to resolve through Route 53 instead of using only the base `npmctl` package.

## Supported Python Versions

`npmctl-route53` supports Python `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`, and `3.14`.

## Why npmctl-route53

- Adds Route 53 DNS provider discovery to `npmctl`
- Lets DNS workflows live beside proxy and certificate desired state
- Keeps AWS DNS dependencies out of the core CLI package
- Supports operator diagnostics through `npmctl dns doctor`
- Provides client helpers for Route 53 DNS change-batch workflows

## FAQ

### What is npmctl-route53?

**Answer:** `npmctl-route53` is a plugin package that teaches `npmctl` how to talk to AWS Route 53 through `boto3` for DNS record operations and DNS provider diagnostics.

### When do I need npmctl-route53?

**Answer:** You need `npmctl-route53` when your `npmctl` workflow includes Route 53 hosted-zone DNS records or when you want `npmctl` to validate Route 53 DNS connectivity and credentials.

### Does npmctl-route53 work without npmctl?

**Answer:** No. `npmctl-route53` is an extension package for `npmctl`, not a standalone CLI.

### Can npmctl-route53 set DNS records?

**Answer:** Yes. The Route 53 provider supports declarative A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, SRV, and CAA writes through `ChangeResourceRecordSets`. MX records require `priority`.

### What credentials are required?

**Answer:** Route 53 access uses the standard AWS credential chain or `ROUTE53_PROFILE`. Diagnostics require hosted-zone and record-set list permissions; mutation helpers require `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets`.

## Install

Install the base CLI and the Route 53 provider package together:

```bash
pipx install npmctl
pipx inject npmctl npmctl-route53
npmctl plugins list
```

With `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install npmctl
uv tool install npmctl-route53
npmctl plugins list
```

Inside a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install npmctl npmctl-route53
npmctl plugins list
```

## Configure Route 53

Use the standard AWS credential chain:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
```

Or use a named profile:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=production-dns
```

Optional package-specific override:

```bash
export ROUTE53_PROFILE=production-dns
```

## Verify Plugin Discovery

Check that `npmctl` can discover the provider:

```bash
npmctl plugins list
npmctl dns doctor --provider route53
```

## Minimal DNS Workflow

Once the provider is installed and configured, `npmctl` can validate, plan, apply, or diagnose Route 53-backed DNS behavior through the base CLI:

```bash
npmctl validate desired-state/dns.yaml
npmctl plan desired-state/dns.yaml --owner site-a
npmctl apply desired-state/dns.yaml --owner site-a
npmctl dns providers
npmctl dns zones --provider route53
npmctl dns records --provider route53 --zone example.com
```

## Route 53 API Surface

The provider follows the AWS Route 53 API through `boto3`:

- `ListHostedZones`: discover hosted zones.
- `ListResourceRecordSets`: list records in one hosted zone.
- `ChangeResourceRecordSets` with `CREATE`: create record sets.
- `ChangeResourceRecordSets` with `UPSERT`: create or update record sets.
- `ChangeResourceRecordSets` with `DELETE`: delete record sets.

Required IAM actions for diagnostics:

- `route53:ListHostedZones`
- `route53:ListResourceRecordSets`

Required IAM action for mutation helpers:

- `route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets`

## Programmatic Record Operations

```python
from npmctl_route53 import Route53Client, Route53Config

client = Route53Client(Route53Config.from_env())
client.create_record("example.com", type="A", name="www", value="192.0.2.10", ttl=300)
client.upsert_record("example.com", type="CNAME", name="app", value="target.example.net", ttl=300)
client.upsert_record("example.com", type="MX", name="@", value="mail.example.com", ttl=300, priority=10)
client.delete_record("example.com", type="A", name="www", value="192.0.2.10", ttl=300)
```

## Safety Notes

- Route 53 changes are hosted-zone scoped. Confirm the selected hosted zone before mutation.
- Prefer IAM policies scoped to the intended hosted zone ARN.
- `UPSERT` can overwrite live DNS answers. Use create-only workflows when adoption is not explicit.
- Use npmctl owner metadata for desired DNS records so apply remains owner-scoped.
